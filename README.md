# Killer Moons From Outer Space
It was a warm day in June, the sun shining, the bees buzzing and kids playing across the world. Little did humanity know that it was just the calm before the storm.

People were busy using their devices that they had become so accustomed to when the problems began. At first it just seemed like normal internet problems but as time went on and the issues spread, people became fascinated by what was happening. They turned to their TVs and radios to listen in, all of their attention focused to this singular problem. Scientists and experts were baffled with no explanation. Then the problems got worse. Around the globe the tides stopped. Like time standing still; the water didn't move, not a drop. The government started to panic and looked to space for clues. It didn't take long to see that... the moon was...

<b>ALIVE!</b>

The government sent probes into space to gather as much detail as they could. Nothing came back until finally a communication... 

*static and crackles fill the audio*

<This is the collective. We have been watching from a distance and we have seen the water that this planet holds. We must have the water for our own, at any cost. You will not survive. Your moon and the moons of this solar system have been awakened by us. We will use them to exterminate your species so we can have the water.>

The governments around the world quickly form a task force to stop the moons and defend the planet. The top pilots around the world have been assembled to join this task force.

You are a member of this highly elite group of space fighters and you have one mission. Stop the moons before humanity is lost.
